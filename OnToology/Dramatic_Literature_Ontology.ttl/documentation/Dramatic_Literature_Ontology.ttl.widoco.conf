abstract=This ontology aims to provide a formal and structured semantic representation of the most relevant elements of a complex dramatic literary work, taking La vida es sueño by Pedro Calderón de la Barca as a case study. The model integrates bibliographic description with structural, metrical, and analytical components traditionally used in literary analysis, enabling a unified representation of both the text and its critical interpretation.

The ontology adopts the FRBR conceptual framework as its structural backbone in order to distinguish between different levels of textual abstraction—work, expression, manifestation, and item—allowing the representation of multiple editions, versions, and academic studies associated with the same literary work. On this basis, the model incorporates domain-specific entities such as acts, scenes, and verses, as well as mechanisms for representing metrical structures, accentual analysis systems, and textual annotations.

Controlled vocabularies are employed to model categorical aspects such as social roles and marital status, avoiding unnecessary class hierarchies and favoring extensibility and reuse. The ontology has been implemented in OWL and evaluated using automated quality-assessment tools, ensuring coherence with current best practices in ontology engineering.

Overall, the ontology demonstrates the applicability of semantic technologies to the formal modeling of literary texts and contributes a reusable and extensible resource for research in the field of Digital Humanities.

description=This ontology defines a structured semantic model for representing the internal organization and analytical features of dramatic texts. It focuses on linking literary structure, formal analysis, and scholarly commentary within a single coherent framework. The model is designed to be extensible and interoperable, supporting digital humanities research and semantic querying of literary works.
